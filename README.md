# Homographic_Lidar_Camera_Calibration
Lidar-Camera calibration using homography to get the best approximate intrinsic and extrinsic matrix (as a single Homeography matrix)
To use this tool,
1. First clone the repo
2. Update the parameters to the right image paths
3. Run `python3 1.py`
4. Select the same keypoints in both of the images you wish to calculate homeography for. The more the better
5. When you're done, press "q"
6. You will see the produced matrix and 50/50 overlay of both images.
