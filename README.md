# Homographic_Lidar_Camera_Calibration
Lidar-Camera calibration using homography to get the best approximate intrinsic and extrinsic matrix (as a single Homeography matrix)
To use this tool,
1. First clone the repo
2. Update the parameters to the right image paths
3. Run `python3 1.py`
4. Select the same keypoints in both of the images you wish to calculate homeography for
5. When you're done, press "q"
6. You will see the produced matrix and 50/50 overlay of both images.
